# Basic Calculator

I created this project in order to test myself with the foundations of JavaScript. This calculator can perform simple tasks, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It will also round off decimals in order to prevent overflow/crowding on the screen.

I have also added the "remainder" option to the calculator as an extra feature.

You can access the calculator [here](https://ved4a.github.io/simple-calculator/). Thanks for dropping by â˜† !

_Later iterations of the code will provide keyboard functionality as well._
