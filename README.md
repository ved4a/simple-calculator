Basic Calculator
I created this project in order to test myself with the foundations of JavaScript. This calculator will be able to perform simple tasks, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It will also round off decimals in order to prevent overflow/crowding on the screen.

Later iterations of the code will provide keyboard functionality as well.
